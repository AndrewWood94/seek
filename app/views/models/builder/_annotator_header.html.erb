      You can use the JWS OneStop annotator to add MIRIAME annotations to the reactions and processes in the model. If your annotation is missing when you select the species or process, you can search for annotation URN's for your species or reaction using Semantic SBML.
      You can also add attribution annotations to the model.<br/>
      When you are finished click the Store button to return to the JWS <em>OneStop</em> editor. Your changes are not saved in <%= Seek::Config.application_name -%> until you save as a new version from <em>OneStop</em>.
