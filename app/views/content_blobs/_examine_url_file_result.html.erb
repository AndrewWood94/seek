        You can either upload this file to <%= Seek::Config.application_name %> using this URL, or you can register a link to the file.

        By selecting the option below, a copy of the file will be made. This is recommended, and is equivalent to uploading
        a file from your disk. It also means that should the data behind the URL become unavailable, the data is still
        available from <%= Seek::Config.application_name %>.
        However, you should be sure that the copyright on the file allows you to do this.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do not select the option below <%= Seek::Config.application_name %> will store only the URL. In this case, when another user
        selects to download the file then they will simply directed to the URL.
