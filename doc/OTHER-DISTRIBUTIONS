= Installing SEEK for other Linux distributions

Our main {Install Guide}[link:doc/INSTALL.html] is based upon the Ubuntu 12.04 (LTS) distribution and version. However, other than the distribution
packages the install process should be very similar for other distributions.

For some other common distributions, we describe here the required distribution packages, and any other differences we are aware of from our general install guide.

== Ubuntu 14.04 (LTS) and Linux Mint 16

Ubuntu 14.04 has only recently been released and we haven't yet fully migrated over to testing on that platform. These differences also relate to Linux Mint 16.
We don't expect any particular problems once SEEK is installed and running, but there are a couple of minor differences that need to be followed.

First, there is an additional package required:

  sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev

then proceed to install SEEK as normal, however after running bundle install to install the gems you may encounter a problem with the <em>Nokogiri</em> gem.
This is because it is statically linked to an older version of <em>LibXML</em>. To solve this, after you have run bundle install do:

  export NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES=1
  gem pristine nokogiri

Following this you can proceed with the standard installation steps.

== Ubuntu 10.04 (LTS)

The general packages:

  sudo apt-get install wget curl mercurial ruby rdoc ri libopenssl-ruby ruby-dev mysql-server libssl-dev build-essential openssh-server git-core
  sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient16-dev libmagick++-dev libxslt-dev libxml++2.6-dev openjdk-6-jdk libsqlite3-dev sqlite3
  sudo apt-get install poppler-utils openoffice.org openoffice.org-java-common

To avoid being prompted during the Ruby 1.9.3 installation with RVM:

  sudo apt-get install libreadline6-dev libyaml-dev autoconf libgdbm-dev libncurses5-dev automake bison libffi-dev

To install the Passenger Phusion module to run SEEK with Apache:

  sudo apt-get install apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-prefork-dev libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev


The command to start soffice is also slightly different, using just single rather than double hyphens for the arguments:

  soffice -headless -accept="socket,host=127.0.0.1,port=8100;urp;" -nofirststartwizard > /dev/null 2>&1 &

If you find the conversion of documents to PDF (for View Content in the browser) is slow, you can install a more recent LibreOffice 3.5
from a separate repository - although this may affect future Operating System upgrades:

   sudo apt-get purge openoffice* libreoffice*
   sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/libreoffice-3-5
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libreoffice

== Debian Wheezy ( version 7.1 )

By default, the user you create for Debian during the installation is not added to the sudoers list. You may want to add your user to the <em>sudo</em> group e.g

  adduser fred sudo

more details can be found at https://wiki.debian.org/sudo

Alternatively, when following the installation run commands that start with <em>sudo</em> as the root user.

The required package names are just the same as for Ubuntu 12.04 - so just follow the install guide.

If you encounter issues related to <em>rvm use</em> - you may need to configure your terminal to run commands as a login shell. There is a checkbox that can be found under the menu <em>Edit</em>, <em>Profile Preferences</em> and then
under the tab <em>Title and Command</em>.
