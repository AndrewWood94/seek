= Contributing to SEEK

SEEK is developed as not only an Open source project, but also an Open development project. We welcome contributions of all kinds,
whether it is source code, improvement suggestions or bug reports. We are always grateful of any contribution regardless of its size.

If you wish to do some development work on SEEK - following our basic {Installation Guide}[link:doc/INSTALL.html] will set up everything you need, including the latest
stable source code.

If you have never used Ruby or Ruby on Rails, we strongly suggest you read through the documentation at http://rubyonrails.org/documentation. There are also many tutorials available
online.

You can contact us through our developers mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/seek-developers . We particularly encourage you to contact us before you start on adding a new
feature, as it maybe something that we have already put some thought into or have in our pipeline.

Our main source code repository can be found at https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek . You can fork or clone this project before making changes to it, and then
make your changes available to us either with patch files or by pointing us at your cloned repository.
