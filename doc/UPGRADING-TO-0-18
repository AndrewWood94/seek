= Upgrading to SEEK 0.18

== Backing up

We always recommend you backup before doing an upgrade, but in this case it is even more important. Please read our
{Backup Guide}[link:doc/BACKUPS.html] for details on what to backup and some tips on how to do so.

== Upgrading a Production SEEK

If you run SEEK in a production environment, first set your environment variable. You will need to do this if you
open a new shell part way through the backup.

  export RAILS_ENV=production

== Stopping Services

If you use init.d scripts to start and stop the Delayed Job or Solr Search services, please stop them using that script.
Otherwise do:

  ./script/delayed_job stop
  bundle exec sunspot:solr:stop

== Installating Package dependencies

Please install the packages described in the {Installation Guide}[link:doc/INSTALL.html]. If you are running a production server, please
also install the packages described in the {Production Installation Guide}[link:doc/INSTALL-PRODUCTION.html]

== Installing Ruby 1.9.3 with RVM

We strongly encourage that you use {RVM}[https://rvm.io/] for managing your Ruby and RubyGems version. Although you can use the version that comes with your linux distribution,
it is more difficult to control the version you use and keep up to date.

To install RVM follow the steps at https://rvm.io/rvm/install . The current basic installation method is to run:

  \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash

to save restarting your shell run:

  source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm

now install Ruby 1.9.3

  rvm install ruby-1.9.3

you may be asked for your password so that some additional packages can be installed. You will then need to wait for Ruby to be downloaded and compiled.

This version of SEEK has been developed and tested using Rubygems version 1.8.25. This is the version installed with Ruby 1.9.3 at the time of writing this, but to be sure run:

  rvm rubygems 1.8.25

Now you just need to create the <em>Gemset</em> for SEEK. RVM allows what it calls <em>Gemsets</em> to seperate the gems installed, in isolation from each other, for different applications.
To create the gemset run:

  rvm gemset create seek

And finally

  rvm use ruby-1.9.3@seek
  gem install bundler

== Fetching and Updating SEEK

You are now ready to fetch the SEEK code and start upgrading. Make sure your <em>RAILS_ENV</em> is still set to <em>production</em> if necessary.

  hg pull https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek -r v0.18.0
  hg update
  hg merge # only required if you've made changes since installing. If you have you may need to deal with conflicts.
  hg commit -m "merged" # likewise - only required if you made changes since installing
  bundle install --deployment

You now need to edit the <em>config/database.yml</em> file, and change the <em>adaptor</em> setting from <em>mysql</em> to <em>mysql2</em>.

If you are unsure what to change, have a look at <em>config/database.default.yml</em>.

Then continue with:

  bundle exec rake db:migrate
  bundle exec rake seek:upgrade
  bundle exec rake tmp:assets:clear
  bundle exec rake tmp:clear

== Converting the database

This bit is a bit fiddly, but is required to update your mysql database to correctly report UTF-8. If you know of a cleaner way to do
this then please let us know!

First refer to <em>config/database.yml</em> to check the database name, and the username and password you use. Then make a dump
of the database using the following, but replacing <mysql_username> and <database_name>:

  mysqldump -u <mysql_username> -p --opt --default-character-set=latin1 --skip-set-charset  <database_name> > seek_db.sql

Now a couple of commands to change the contents of the dump

  sed -e 's/CHARSET=latin1/CHARSET=utf8/g' seek_db.sql > seek_db_utf8.sql
  sed -e 's/COLLATE=utf8_unicode_ci//g' seek_db_utf8.sql > seek_db_converted.sql

Now refresh the database from the dump:

  mysql -u <mysql_username> -p <database_name> < seek_db_converted.sql

If you have started up SEEK before doing this conversion you may need to clear the SEEK cache:

  bundle exec rake tmp:clear

You can now clear out the intermediate files:

  rm seek_db.sql seek_db_utf8.sql seek_db_converted.sql


== Updating the init.d scripts

If you use init.d scripts to start and stop the Delayed Job, Solr Search and Soffice services, you may need to update these.

Solr Search - https://gist.github.com/3143434

Delayed Job - https://gist.github.com/3169625

Soffice - https://gist.github.com/3787679

== Starting up SEEK and the Services

You can now startup the services, either using the init.d scripts or by running:

  bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start
  ./script/delayed_job start

If you don't use SEEK with Apache, the command to start it is now:

  bundle exec rails server

=== Updating Passenger Phusion

If you run SEEK with Apache, you may find you need to update and reconfigure Apache and Passenger Phusion. Please follow the steps
in this section of the {Production Installation Guide}[link:doc/INSTALL-PRODUCTION.html]
