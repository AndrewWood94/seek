<h1 id="label-Upgrading+SEEK">Upgrading SEEK</h1>

<p>If you have an existing SEEK installation, and you haven&#39;t done so
already, please take a moment to fill out our very short,optional <a
href="http://www.sysmo-db.org/seek-registration">SEEK Registration
Form</a>. Doing so will be very useful to us in the future when we try and
raise further funding to develop and support SEEK and the associated tools.</p>

<p><strong>Always backup your SEEK data before starting to upgrade!!</strong>
- see the <a href="BACKUPS.html">Backup Guide</a>.</p>

<p>This guide assumes that SEEK has been installed following the <a
href="INSTALL.html">Installation Guide</a> guide. It assumes it is a
production server that is being updated, and that commands are run from the
root directory of the SEEK application.</p>

<p>If your current installation is not linked to to the SEEK BitBucket
Mercurial repository, it can still easily be updated by taking the next
stable tag, reconfiguring the database configuration to point at your
existing database, and copying across the <em>filestore/</em> directory.
The upgrade steps can then be followed, with the Mercurial (hg) steps
omitted.</p>

<h2 id="label-Identifying+your+version">Identifying your version</h2>

<p>The version of SEEK you are running is shown at the bottom left, within the
footer, when viewing pages in SEEK.</p>

<p>You can also tell which version you have installed by looking at the
<em>config/version.yml</em> file, so for example version 0.13.2 looks
something like:</p>

<pre>major: 0
minor: 13
patch: 2</pre>

<h2 id="label-General+notes+about+versions+and+upgrading">General notes about versions and upgrading</h2>

<p><strong>If upgrading from a version earlier than v0.11.x please contact
us.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Also if upgrading from a Mercurial based SEEK to our Git one,
please contact us. Mercurial versions of SEEK are only available up to
v0.21.</strong></p>

<p>You can find details on how to contact us at: <a
href="http://seek4science.org/contact">seek4science.org/contact</a></p>

<p>When upgrading between versions greater than v0.11.x you need to upgrade to
each released minor version in order incrementally (i.e. 0.13.x -&gt;
0.14.x -&gt; 0.15.x -&gt; 0.16.x, you can skip patch versions such as
0.13.3).</p>

<p>Each version has a tag in mercurial, which has the format of <em>v</em>
prefix followed by the version - e.g. v0.11.1, v0.13.2, v0.17.1</p>

<p><strong>When upgrading between minor versions (i.e. from 0.11.x to
0.13.x)</strong> it is necessary to run a seek:upgrade rake task to perform
upgrade changes and import any new data. The upgrade task may require an
internet connection, and sometimes can take some time to run, so please be
patient. There are instructions for upgrading between each minor version
listed below, but they will generally follow the same pattern. Upgrading to
version 0.18 is an exception and involves some additional steps - due to
the upgrade of the required versions of Rails and Ruby.</p>

<p><strong>When upgrading between patch versions (i.e between 0.16.0 and
0.16.3)</strong> it should only be necessary to run <em>bundle install</em>
and the <em>db:migrate</em> rake task. Using seek:upgrade should still
work, but could take a lot of unnecessary time. There is more details and
an example towards the end of the this page.</p>

<h2 id="label-Steps+to+upgrade+from+0.21.x+to+0.22.x">Steps to upgrade from 0.21.x to 0.22.x</h2>

<p><strong>If you need to upgrade from v0.21 based on Mercurial rather than
Git or the downloaded tarball, please contact us on our mailing
lists.</strong></p>

<h3 id="label-Stopping+services+before+upgrading">Stopping services before upgrading</h3>

<pre>export RAILS_ENV=production # if upgrading a production server - remember to set this again if closing and reopening the shell
bundle exec rake seek:workers:stop
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:stop</pre>

<h3 id="label-Update+Ruby+with+RVM">Update Ruby with RVM</h3>

<p>Although not critical, we recommend updating Ruby to 2.1.5. If you are
using RVM, as recommended in the installation, you can do this with:</p>

<pre>rvm get stable
rvm install ruby-2.1.5</pre>

<h3 id="label-Updating+from+GitHub">Updating from GitHub</h3>

<p>If you have an existing installation linked to our GitHub, you can fetch
the files with:</p>

<pre>git pull https://github.com/seek4science/seek.git
git checkout v0.22.0</pre>

<h3 id="label-Updating+using+the+tarball">Updating using the tarball</h3>

<p>Starting with version 0.22, we&#39;ve started making SEEK available as a
download. You can download the file from <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek/downloads/seek-0.22.0.tgz">bitbucket.org/seek4science/seek/downloads/seek-0.22.0.tgz</a>
You can unpack this file using:</p>

<pre>tar zxvf seek-0.22.0.tgz</pre>

<p>and then copy across your existing filestore and database configuration
file from your previous installation and continue with the upgrade steps.
The database configuration file you would need to copy is
<em>config/database.yml</em>, and the filestore is simply
<em>filestore/</em></p>

<h3 id="label-Doing+the+upgrade">Doing the upgrade</h3>

<p>After updating the files, the following steps will update the database,
gems, and other necessary changes:</p>

<pre>cd .. &amp;&amp; cd seek #this is to allow RVM to pick up the ruby and gemset changes
bundle install --deployment
bundle exec rake seek:upgrade
bundle exec rake assets:precompile # this task will take a while
bundle exec rake seek:workers:start
bundle exec rake sunspot:solr:start
touch tmp/restart.txt
bundle exec rake tmp:clear</pre>

<h2 id="label-Earlier+upgrade+notes">Earlier upgrade notes</h2>
